# XIV

## Glossary of Terms
### PC: Player Character
### NPC: Non-Player Character
### RPG: Role-Playing Game

# Description

XIV is a designed videogame project in exectuion of a new theory of the "roguelike". Roguelikes in 
the traditional vein necessitate a certain structure that can be expressed in the following facets:
* movement-based time progression
* "roleplaying" mechanics borrowed from the affordances of tabletop roleplaying games
* "permanence" mechanics, involving the loss of progression in various forms

XIV seeks to critique these facets and hopefully arrive at an experience that is at once dynamic,
narratively interesting, and wide in its possibility space.

Movement in XIV does away with movement-based time progression, freeing up the system to allow the
world to update and breathe irrespective of the player.

Roleplaying in XIV involves the intelligent use of myriad "affordances", that allow for interesting 
and engaging interactions that are both constructive and destructive.

Permanence in XIV involves allowing for life after death, eliciting a sense of tension with the
dangers of the world while still allowing the player to survive and thrive with relative ease.

# RIGHT CLICK ON EVERYTHING

Right clicking on anything in the game world brings up a list of possible interactions with that 
thing. Clicking on an action adds that action to its associated command-queue.

Certain options will always be available no matter what is clicked on. These will be actions like 
"look at", "yell at", "approach", "initiate combat".

In single-player combat, a good accessibility option might be to slow down time when the list is 
open to allow time to react. This accessibility could also be worked directly into the game through
a "slowtime" spell of a sort.

## EXAMPLES

| Example                 |
| ----------------------- |
| look at                 |
| yell at                 |
| talk to >               |
| approach >              |
| follow >                |
| cast nonviolent spell > |
| initiate combat >>      |

| approach |
| -------- |
| walk     |
| sneak    |
| charge   |

| follow |

# THE COMMAND QUEUES

There will be two queues for managing sequences of player activity both within & without combat: a
"life" queue and a "combat" queue

The PC will execute whatever action is first in the active queue, then move on to the next. This 
allows for more careful planning in managing work, needs, betterment, leisure, and combat actions.

Actions in the command queue are not static, they can be reordered and cancelled at will.

Some activities might require multiple "steps" to achieve prior to actually performing the
interaction. I'd like the player to have freedom over the outcome and let the desire for those
outcomes drive the command-queue choices. i don't want the player to have to learn 5000000000
different processes for every form of creation in the game.

# NEEDS

Natural system involving the "balancing" of basic needs, rather than the occasional upkeep of a 
singular "hunger/thirst meter" in many RPGs and sandboxes. 

Needs, when taken care of, contribute to the PC's general wellness, and give them bonuses to all
skills and abilities. When left alone, the general wellness decreases, and it becomes more difficult
for the PC to perform their activities quickly and effectively.

Needs can be basic as well as abstract. food, water, physical comfort, recreation, food health,
social (needing both time with people as well as time alone), physical exercise.

Needs should be enjoyable to take care of. As long as the character feels more like a "sim" or a 
"pet" to nurture and care for, needs will work.

# EVERYTHING IS A SKILL

No "level" system. No general exp that gets applied broadly. Everything is a skill, and skills have
levels. However, there should be no arbitrary numbers for denoting skill levels. I want obscure
descriptions of the PC's abilities in various areas.

Skills do not depreciate over time.

## EXAMPLE

| skill            |     level     |
| ---------------- | :-----------: |
| swimming         | above average |
| physical fitness | below average |
| rifle knowledge  |    average    |
| aiming           |     poor      |
| hauling          |    expert     |

Outside of "innate" skills, skills are discoverd through one of two methods:
* Doing the thing.
* Reading a book!

Reading takes longer but produces better, more consistent results, while practicing skills is less
time-consuming but produces inconsistent results. I don't want books to be so rare that they're 
unaffordable and inaccessible, but I do want them to feel like treasures. They are a source of
consistent, low-risk knowledge up to a certain level. 

Books should be equipped, offering a consistent source of skill development over time that occurs 
passively, when the PC is resting or idling.

Magic-related skills also exist here but spells are not skills. Examples of these include "arcane 
knowledge", "reading", "spellsummoning", "muscle-memory", and "memory"

# MAGIC

## MAGIC IS RARE AND INTERESTING
I want magic to be extremely rare. The economy of magic needs to be sparse as hell. Barely anyone 
in the world is capable of it, and most that are capable are usually only able to muster simple
spells. I want magic users to endure great strain and hardship to be able to loose spells, because
when they finally gain that power, they become very hard to reckon with.

The ceiling for what is possible with magic must be somewhat high as well. "Magic is gamebreaking".
I want to elicit this sense that magic is this huge, unexplored frontier of utility.

Every spell needs to be meaningful and distinct, performing a specific function that is different 
from any other spell. Prefer "messing with reality" over five different elemental "bolt" spells lol.

## BECOMING
The first spell a budding mage attempts to learn is always the hardest. At this point, you have
next to no magical knowledge whatsoever, so you have no clue how to tune your body and mind to 
produce a spell. In order to even start learning spealls you must unlock your magical potential,
either by learning from a teacher, by reading a special skillbook. 

Another, albeit less reliable, way to learn spellcasting is by being hit by a spell. There are 
stories going around saying that this has been known to enable magical ability in the victim.

I want magic to not be something you can just beeline towards at the start of the game, becoming a 
mage in the first hour. No. Focus on building out your existence in the world, become established,
explore, and let the magic find you.

## MAGICAL MASTERY
Any spell that the PC tries to learn should be unwieldy and wild until it is mastered, and mastery
is a long road. Once you know how to cast a spell, you will have to cast it many times to get the
practice you need to cast it reliably. This changes how you utilize magic over the course of 
becoming a mage. I hope this creates a relationship to your spells and gives the character a 
narrative befitting a mage. Spells unmastered can sputter, fail, fly off in an undesirable direction,
exhaust you, harm you, explode, etc. before they fully take shape.

Acquiring spells is difficult and time consuming. Players who wish to practice more than a few spells
will need to dedicate lots of time and energy around the acquisition and refinement of their spells.
Spells, in this way, are like skills albeit with a major difference. There are no spell "levels"
per se, only "unmastered" and "mastered" states. The path to mastery will be fraught with failure,
and difficult to measure progress in. Progress, rather than being measured by a level or a number,
has more to do with the player actively observing how often the PC fails to cast a spell. 

## EXAMPLE SPELLS

### ALIGHT:
* Simultaneously an ignition spell as well as a method of mitigating damage from falling.
* Good because of its double-entedre, as well as its relative ambiguity in application. What
  happens if I cast it on a torch? A bird? Myself?

### TELE:
* Vanish any object, and make it reappear anywhere within a certain radius of your body.
* Good because of its wide applicability. Try TELE on a wall, someone's money pouch, an arrow flying
  towards you.

# COMBAT

Think of combat as a "state" that can be entered at any time, with any thing, as soon as combat is
"initiated". Initiating combat doesn't do anything except change the list of options that are 
available upon right clicking, as well as shelving the life-queue and starting up a new combat-queue.

Combat occurs in real-time, with no ability to pause the action to issue commands. You must queue up
those commands in real time, whilst fighting. The "trick" of combat is learning to navigate the
command menu swiftly and decisively, queuing up actions in advance as quickly as possible and
watching them play out.

Actions take time to complete, so while your character is going through them you have time to
consider follow-up actions and reorder the queue as you see fit. Combat then becomes a sort of 
passive management of actions, positioning, and character status. It's important that combat has the
capacity to be resolved extremely quickly with proper skill, while still allowing enough time
for the player to consider their actions carefully. 

Entering a combat state doesn't necessitate that the recipient of violence is aware of impending
violence. Usually combat will be entered mutually when you perform a hostile action against an NPC,
such as yelling at them with your weapon drawn, or approching them with your weapon drawn without
sneaking behind them first.

To allow for time at the start of combat to consider reactions, I will implement a "guard" stance.
Pop this off at the start of combat to reduce damage against you and automatically attempt to
defend yourself when struck. A guard stance will also pause the actions waiting in your queue until
you leave the stance. Anyone can guard, but guarding is more effective with higher associated skill 
levels, specific types of weapons / magic, or a shield.

# "PERMA"-DEATH

When your character dies is a sad day indeed. Over the course of your time with the PC you have most
likely developed a strong relationship to that character's identity, and a close investment in the
minutae of their daily lives. 

Therefore, death is not the end of your character. When you die, your PC becomes a ghost.
Your character's ghost will not be able to resurrect itself, even if your PC knew RESURRECT. However, 
resurrection is a well-known and highly esteemed school of magic, of which there will be practitioners
in the world. Your options for resurrection are threefold:

1. Compel a mage to resurrect your body for a fee upon resurrection. 
2. Compel another player who knows RESURRECT to resurrect you.
3. Create another PC to either do (1) or learn RESURRECT and use it on your other character.

# A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO POSSESSIONS

Possessions are limited to what you can carry on your person and store in a chest. This is perhaps
the most "realist" aspect of the game's design. PCs can only carry so much in their arms, and
usually you'll need to dedicate your arms to carrying weapons and the like. 

Enter backpacks. Backpacks allow for storage of a limited amount of items, provided they can fit
inside. In a backpack you may store provisions, ammunition, etc. and this is all handled in a 
"diablo"-esque grid-based inventory. A backpack might also have side pockets, or a strap to allow
for carrying of longer weapons. 

Everything you carry on your person weighs something, as well. You may choose to carry five iron
longswords, but their weight is going to slow you down in many ways, especially in combat.

You may store lots more items in a chest or a fridge, without weight penalties. 

Why???? I will answer this with another question: Did Bilbo Baggins take his entire house with him
to the misty mountains?

This will elicit a relationship with one's "home", wherever that may be. 

# AUTONOMY, REST, & RELAXATION

PC's are not necessarily driven by AI, but certain interactions involve "AI-like" behaviour. Most of
the time, the PC is at the mercy of the player, but inevitably the PC will grow tired and need rest
and recreation to recover. This can come in many forms, as I'd rather not relegate this category 
entirely to "sleep".

Beds that the player has access to can be slept in to advance time and satisfy the need for sleep.

The player also has the ability to select any location as a "rest" point, wherein the PC will sit 
down for a while and autonomously "relax". Any number of things can occur while a PC is relaxing, 
such as reading an equipped book, taking a short nap, eating food, drinking water, drawing in the 
sand, etc. 

Resting can be made easier, more comfortable, and leisurely by ensuring a restful environment for
your character. This can be accomplished through many methods. Resting indoors is usually better,
better yet if you have a nice warm fire and friends to keep you company. Maybe a pet. Maybe some
warm food.

# FOOD & COOKING

All food is edible. Cooking the food into various dishes is even better, providing benefits to more
than just the need for hunger.

Certain dishes are edible on the go, as well as storable in a backpack. Other dishes require carrying
in both hands, or storage in a chest or cellar. These more elaborate dishes provide the best benefits,
which will incentivize taking a break with your PC to cook and eat a proper meal. Larger, unstorable 
dishes can only be carried to a rest point and eaten in a rest state. This is yet another reason to 
have your character rest. 

All food goes bad over time, but not as quickly as most games. Food should deteriorate over the course
of a week in-game, thereabouts, before it becomes unsafe to eat. Storing food ups the shelf-life
considerably.

# DIALOGUE

NPCs in the world can be interacted with in a holistic, functional way, rather than directly through
dialogue. Social interaction with NPCs is communicated through your intentions. So, if you intend
to talk to an NPC to satisfy your social needs, that will be an option.

| talk                         |
| ---------------------------- |
| talk about your day (social) |
| tell a funny story (fun)     |
| trade                        |
| compel >                     |

| compel           |
| ---------------- |
| protect me (10g) |
| resurrect (100g) |
| run away         |

# CRAFTING AND CARPENTRY

Most of what you get in this world will come from three sources:
1. Finding stuff out in the world.
2. Buying stuff from people.
3. Making stuff yourself.

Making things yourself requires the appropriate materials, tools, and workstations in order to 
accomplish. For example, acquiring ore requires a pickaxe and access to ore rocks, refining metal 
requires a furnace, hammering out a weapon or piece of armor requires an anvil, etc. 

The PC can also build things in the world. Acquire materials for various carpentry-related objects
and build your own house to your liking.

I want this system of carpentry to be abstract enough that it's accessible from the beginning.
Any PC can go out and gather materials for a shelter at any time. 

It might be better to do away with the "materials" aspect of carpentry as much as possible, opting
to allow the PC to literally pick up walls and move them around. 

This system requires lots more thought and revision.
